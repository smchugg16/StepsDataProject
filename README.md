# Personal Activity Tracker

## Overview:
This project analyzes my personal activity data recorded by the Apple Health app from July to November of 2025. The goal of this project is to understand how different factors (like Weather Conditions and Day of The Week) influence my daily activity levels.

## Methodology

- **Data Retrieval:**  
  My [Steps Data](https://github.com/smchugg16/StepsDataProject/blob/main/StepsDataJuly2025.xlsx) was collected from the Apple Health app on my iPhone. Weather data was pulled from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) and combined with the Apple Health data in a master data sheet using Excel. Additional variables included:
  - High and low temperature (°F)
  - Precipitation levels (in inches)
  - General weather conditions for each date

- **Visualization:**  
  The dataset was imported into Tableau to create visualizations that showcase and interpret my Personal Activity. These included:
  - Total number of steps
  - Average steps per day
  - Most active month (by average daily steps)
  - Monthly average step count (line graph)
  - Relationship between weather type and step count (box-and-whisker plot)
  - Average activity by day of the week (bar chart)
  - Correlation between high temperature and step count (scatter plot + regression line)
